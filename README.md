# ATOMY.CAT

> atomy.cat is hosted on `Github pages` to deploy and allow everyone to acess its contents

> The page is a SPA (single page application) that can be used for several other purposes aside from providing simple details on the products and information on the items

The following are some TODO's for the project:

- **INFORMATIVE**
    - [x] Atomy product - MRP | DP | PV
    - [ ] Tutorials
    - [ ] Step-by-step **Guides** to help understand the use of ~~third party~~ apps like `Google Meet`, `Whatsapp`
    - [ ] Links to other `platforms` that teach the usage

## UI - mobile friendly approaches
Mobile friendly approach is necessary to enable the users in using the application with ease and comfort without any complex task and having basic idea, anyone can use the full potential of the application

```js
// USAGE OF JS IN THE APPLICATION IN IMMENSE
jQuery(function(){
    // ALL CODES GO IN HERE
})

// NOTE THAT JQUERY 3.6.0 IS USED FOR THIS PROJECT
```
